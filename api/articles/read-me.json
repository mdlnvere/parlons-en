  "content": "## Hello there, I'm Anne-Sophie Vere 👋\r\nI'm a French creative developer and web designer. I love combining clean code with strong visuals — from smart home apps to elegant websites. Currently freelancing, I craft digital tools that are both useful and bold. \r\n\r\n- I like to build stuff and **beautiful things**\r\n- I also like **litterature, reading and writing.** \r\n- You'll usually find me coding, lost in a book, or sketching something.\r\n  \r\nWhen I’m not building for a client (or myself), I’m adding new prints to my Etsy shop.\r\n\r\n## What I've been up to : \r\n\r\n- 🔧 Working on Homey apps for connected devices  \r\n- ✍️ Designing beautiful websites with Symfony, Twig & Tailwind  \r\n- 🎨 Running a creative illustration shop: [atelierillustre](https://atelierrecolorer.etsy.com)\r\n\r\n### Check out my latest Homey app:  \r\n[Homey X Hitachi Aircloud Go](https://homey.app/fr-fr/app/com.vere.AirCloud/Hitachi-airCloud-Go/)  ",
